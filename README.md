# README
By default, the make file will compile the program to bin/lineWriter.
You may need to make modifications to the Makefile for your OS (I'm working on Manjaro Linux).

I created this program to create a decently efficient way to modify a single line of a file.
It's easier than doing it manually in bash everytime.
I hope this can be useful to you in some way!
See the *LICENSE* file for details.

You can move the generated *lineWriter* file to wherever you need it.
Then, run *./lineWriter fileName line "String"*
This will then write the String to that line of the file.
